# Proof-of-Work-in-Bitcoin-Blockchain
Python Implementation of Proof of Work
In this project, our objective was to implement a DSS module and a hash chain-based authentication of length 3 for Proof of Work i.e., blockchain with length 3. 
The project includes 3 main tasks: 
i) Generating Private and Public keys for 3 blocks of blockchain and verifying them. 
ii) After generating the keys, the next step was to generate the signatures for the user transactions using a DSS module. SHA3-224 is used as hash function for the module. 
iii) The third and the most important step was to demonstrate the proof of work. Computations for T1 and T2 are carried out using the SHA3-224 function and a pre image of fixed hash format was generated.
 
Exhaustive search method was used and mostly the project was implemented in Python with some calculations done in Sage.
